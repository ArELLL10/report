        <p><b>EULERIAN CIRCUIT (OR EULERIAN CYCLE)</b></p>
        <p>•	AN <b>EULERIAN CIRCUIT IS A CLOSED PATH (CYCLE) THAT STARTS AND ENDS AT THE SAME VERTEX</b> WHILE VISITING EVERY EDGE EXACTLY ONCE.<br>
            •	FOR A GRAPH TO HAVE AN EULERIAN CIRCUIT, EVERY VERTEX MUST HAVE AN EVEN DEGREE, AND THE GRAPH MUST BE CONNECTED (ALL VERTICES WITH EDGES MUST BE REACHABLE FROM ANY OTHER VERTEX IN THE GRAPH).<br>
            •	CONDITIONS: A GRAPH HAS AN EULERIAN CIRCUIT IF ALL VERTICES HAVE AN EVEN DEGREE AND THE GRAPH IS CONNECTED (MEANING EVERY VERTEX WITH EDGES CAN BE REACHED FROM ANY OTHER VERTEX).
