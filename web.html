        <p><b>I. Introduction to Graph Theory</b></p>
        <p><b>Definition of Graphs:</b></p>
        <p><b>Graph Theory</b> is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects.
            <br>It has applications across many disciplines, including computer science, biology, social networks, and transport systems, among others.
            <br>A graph is a collection of objects called <b>vertices</b> (or nodes) and the connections between them, called <b>edges</b> (or arcs).
            <br>Graph theory provides a framework for analyzing and solving problems related to networks, connectivity, flow, and structure.
