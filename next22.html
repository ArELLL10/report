        <p><b>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</b></p>
        <p>•<b>HAMILTONIAN GRAPHS:</b><br><br>
            o	HAMILTONIAN PATH: VISITS EACH VERTEX EXACTLY ONCE.<br>ITS EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON THE GRAPH’S STRUCTURE;<br>THERE IS NO SIMPLE RULE TO DETERMINE IT.<br><br>
            o	HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT: A CLOSED LOOP THAT VISITS EACH VERTEX ONCE.<br>LIKE HAMILTONIAN PATHS, DETERMINING A HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT IS COMPUTATIONALLY CHALLENGING.<br><br>
            <b>ADVANCED CONCEPTS IN GRAPH THEORY</b><br><br>
            •	WEIGHTED GRAPHS: EACH EDGE HAS A WEIGHT, OFTEN USED IN ROUTE OPTIMIZATION TO REPRESENT DISTANCES, COSTS, OR CAPACITIES.<br><br>
            •	PLANAR GRAPHS: GRAPHS THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON A PLANE WITHOUT ANY EDGES CROSSING, USEFUL IN GEOGRAPHICAL MAPPING AND CIRCUIT DESIGN.<br><br>
            •	CONNECTIVITY: MEASURES A GRAPH'S RESILIENCE TO EDGE OR VERTEX REMOVAL. A GRAPH IS STRONGLY CONNECTED IF THERE’S A PATH BETWEEN EVERY PAIR OF VERTICES IN A DIRECTED GRAPH, CRITICAL IN NETWORK RELIABILITY<br>
