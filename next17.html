        <p><b>DIRECTED GRAPH</b></p>
        <p>A <b>DIRECTED GRAPH (OR DIGRAPH)</b> IS A TYPE OF GRAPH WHERE <b>EACH EDGE HAS A SPECIFIC DIRECTION.</b><br>
            IN A DIRECTED GRAPH, AN EDGE IS REPRESENTED AS AN ORDERED PAIR OF VERTICES, INDICATING A ONE-WAY CONNECTION FROM THE STARTING VERTEX (TAIL) TO THE ENDING VERTEX (HEAD).<br>
            THIS DIRECTIONALITY CONTRASTS WITH UNDIRECTED GRAPHS, WHERE EDGES HAVE NO INHERENT DIRECTION, AND CONNECTIONS ARE TWO-WAY.
