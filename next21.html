        <p>•<b>DIRECTED GRAPHS:</b> THESE GRAPHS HAVE EDGES WITH SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS, 
                IDEAL FOR MODELING RELATIONSHIPS LIKE TRAFFIC FLOW, FLIGHT PATHS, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS.<br><br>
            	<b>EULERIAN GRAPHS:</b><br><br>
                •	EULERIAN PATH: TRAVERSES EVERY EDGE EXACTLY ONCE. IN DIRECTED GRAPHS, IT EXISTS IF:<br><br>
                o	ONE VERTEX HAS ONE EXTRA OUTGOING EDGE.<br>
                o	ONE VERTEX HAS ONE EXTRA INCOMING EDGE.<br>
                o	ALL OTHER VERTICES HAVE EQUAL INCOMING AND OUTGOING EDGES.<br>
                o	EULERIAN CIRCUIT: A CLOSED PATH THAT TRAVERSES EVERY EDGE ONCE, POSSIBLE IF ALL VERTICES HAVE EQUAL INCOMING AND OUTGOING EDGES, AND THE GRAPH IS STRONGLY CONNECTED.
